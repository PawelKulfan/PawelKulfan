## My projects:
**APS Energia webpage testing** - Project for exploratory & usability tests of APS Energia production company webpage: www.apsenergia.pl. In its repo You can find Test Plan, reports from test sessions and final report for conducted tests.

**Automated Tests HotelTestLab**  - Project conducted during Automation Tester course. Set of automated tests (user registration, hotel search, room booking) for example hotel booking page. Project covered only part of page functionalities.

**Automated Tests MyStore**  - Another project conducted during Automation Tester course, being credit assignment of the course. Involves couple exercises, which tested diffrent aspects of this example store. Project covered only part of page functionalities.

**Java Projects** - this project involves many tasks conducted during Java part of the Automation Tester course. Shows usage of basic skills and techniques used for writing object oriented Java code. Two big assigments in this project were Calculator and Library Catalog. **Calculator** gives possibility to count 6 difrent operations and makes list of every operation made with the outcome. List can be printed in command line or cleared. **Catalog** is an example of my work with objects, inheritance and arrays used for storing book and users info. Books can be rented (script checks, if book is available to rent), which increases their popularity, and signed to particular user account. Users can return single or all books, and user book catalog can be printed in command line
